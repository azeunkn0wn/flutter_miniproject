# My First Flutter App

The app that I work on while learning full stack mobile/web development from scratch with flutter.

## Backend:

https://github.com/azeunkn0wn/myapp_backend.git

## Changelog

* Added backed. The app is no longer connecting to DB directly.
* I added some sort of MVC, but I'm not sure if it's a proper one. Will work on it while doing ORM.


### ToDo
* Use Angel-ORM
* Optimize navigation and state management
* Data Persistence with SQLite
* Improve widget layout design
* Practice API security
* Add animations maybe?
